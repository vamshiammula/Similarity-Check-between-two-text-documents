Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks

All about masks in the context of COVID-19
Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.
If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.
Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:
•	Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
•	Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. 
•	When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
•	Don’t use masks with valves.
WHO advises that people always consult and abide by local authorities on recommended practices in their area. An international and multidisciplinary expert group brought together by WHO reviewed evidence on COVID-19 disease and transmission in children and the limited available evidence on the use of masks by children.
Based on this and other factors such as childrens’ psychosocial needs and developmental milestones, WHO and UNICEF advise the following:
Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance.
WHO and UNICEF advise that the decision to use masks for children aged 6-11 should be based on the following factors:
•	Whether there is widespread transmission in the area where the child resides
•	The ability of the child to safely and appropriately use a mask
•	Access to masks, as well as laundering and replacement of masks in certain settings (such as schools and childcare services)
•	Adequate adult supervision and instructions to the child on how to put on, take off and safely wear masks
•	Potential impact of wearing a mask on learning and psychosocial development, in consultation with teachers, parents/caregivers and/or medical providers
•	Specific settings and interactions the child has with other people who are at high risk of developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with other underlying health conditions
WHO and UNICEF advise that children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.
In general, children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This advice is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance. There may be local requirements for children aged 5 years and under to wear masks, or specific needs in some settings, such as being physically close to someone who is ill. In these circumstances, if the child wears a mask, a parent or other guardian should be within direct line of sight to supervise the safe use of the mask.
The use of masks for children of any age with developmental disorders, disabilities or other specific health conditions should not be mandatory and be assessed on a case by case basis by the child’s parent, guardian, educator and/or medical provider. In any case, children with severe cognitive or respiratory impairments with difficulties tolerating a mask should not be required to wear masks.
Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis or cancer should wear a medical mask in consultation with their medical providers. A medical mask provides protection to the person wearing the mask and prevents transmission to others. It is recommended for anyone who has underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of serious illness.
Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child.
Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis, cancer or immunosuppression, should, in consultation with their medical providers, wear a medical mask. A medical mask controls spreading of the virus and protection to the wearer, and is recommended for anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.
Children should follow the same principles as adults for wearing masks. This includes cleaning hands at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, or at least 40 seconds if using soap and water, before putting on the mask. Make sure the mask is the right size to cover the nose, mouth and chin.  Children should be taught how to wear the mask properly, including not touching the front of the mask and not pulling it under the chin or into their mouth. They should store the mask in a bag or container, and not share the mask with others.
Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask.
A household member who is sick or has tested positive with the virus that causes COVID-19 should be isolated from everyone else if possible. If the child comes within 1 metre of the sick person at home, the adult and child should wear a medical mask during that time.
In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another.
Adults aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.
Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise their breathing. When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures: maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use. 
In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others.
If a decision is made to use a face shield, it should cover the entire face, wrap around the sides of the face and extend to below the chin. Caution should be taken while wearing one to avoid injuries that could break it and harm the eyes or face. 
Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives.
Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more.
Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission.
Health workers in contact with and/or who care for COVID-19 patients are at a higher risk of infection than the general population. Mitigating and reducing this risk is essential to protecting their well-being and reducing the spread of COVID-19. • Available scientific evidence suggests that appropriate personal protective equipment use, hand hygiene best practices, implementation of universal masking policies in health care facilities and adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) training and education are associated with decreased risk of COVID-19 among health workers. • The prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections in health workers requires a multi-pronged integrated approach that includes occupational health and safety (OHS) measures as well as IPC. All healthcare facilities should establish or strengthen and implement (a) IPC programmes and (b) Occupational Health and Safety programmes with protocols to ensure HW safety and prevent HW infections while in the work environment. Ensuring adequate clinical staffing levels is recommended to prevent the transmission of health care-associated infections. • Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health workers can be achieved through syndromic surveillance and/or laboratory testing and is a key strategy to prevent secondary transmission from health workers to patients, between health workers throughout health-care settings and from health workers to contacts outside of health facilities. A national and/or local surveillance and testing strategy should be developed and implemented. • A system for managing exposures based on risk assessment should be in place to promote and support health workers’ reporting of occupational and non-occupational exposures to or symptoms of COVID-19. • A system for managing suspected infections, including measures for health workers who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who are symptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, should be in place. • Clear criteria for returning to work should be established according to the WHO principles for discontinuing isolation for COVID-19. • Health systems and facilities should maintain a blame-free culture with regards to COVID-19 infections in health workers. • WHO has provided several tools for surveillance and studies to better understand the extent of infections and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among health workers
Medical masks are recommended for:
•	Health workers in clinical settings.
•	Anyone who is feeling unwell, including people with mild symptoms, such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue.
•	Anyone awaiting COVID-19 test results or who has tested positive.
•	People caring for someone who is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 outside of health facilities.
Medical masks are also recommended for the following groups, because they are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and dying:
•	People aged 60 or over.
•	People of any age with underlying health conditions, including chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, immunocompromised patients and diabetes mellitus.
Non-medical, fabric masks can be used by the general public under the age of 60 and who do not have underlying health conditions.
In areas where the virus is circulating, masks should be worn when you’re in crowded settings, where you can’t be at least 1 metre from others, and in rooms with poor or unknown ventilation. It’s not always easy to determine the quality of ventilation, which depends on the rate of air change, recirculation and outdoor fresh air. So if you have any doubts, it’s safer to simply wear a mask.
You should always clean your hands before and after using a mask, and before touching it while wearing it.
While wearing a mask, you should still keep physical distance from others as much as possible. Wearing a mask does not mean you can have close contact with people.
For indoor public settings such as busy shopping centres, religious buildings, restaurants, schools and public transport, you should wear a mask if you cannot maintain physical distance from others.
If a visitor comes to your home who is not a member of the household, wear a mask if you cannot maintain a physical distance or the ventilation is poor.
When outside, wear a mask if you cannot maintain physical distance from others. Some examples are busy markets, crowded streets and bus stops. 
Even when you’re in an area of COVID-19 transmission, masks should not be worn during vigorous physical activity because of the risk of reducing your breathing capacity. No matter how intensely you exercise, keep at least 1 metre away from others, and if you’re indoors, make sure there is adequate ventilation.
 Check for filtration, breathability and fit when choosing a fabric mask. It should be held in place comfortably with little adjustment using elastic bands or ties. There are different mask shapes such as flat-fold or duckbill – find the one that fits closely over your nose, cheeks and chin. When the edges of the mask are not close to the face and shift, such as when speaking, air penetrates through the edges of the mask rather than being filtered through the fabric. Masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask.
Fabric masks should be made of three layers of fabric:
•	Inner layer of absorbent material, such as cotton.
•	Middle layer of non-woven non-absorbent material, such as polypropylene.
•	Outer layer of non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend.
If purchasing a fabric mask from a store, check to make sure it meets national performance standards.
How to put on and wear a fabric mask:
•	Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
•	Inspect the mask for tears or holes, do not use a mask that is damaged.
•	Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides.
•	Place the straps behind your head or ears. Do not cross the straps because this can cause gaps on the side of your face.
•	Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If you touch it, clean your hands.
•	Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet.
How to take off and store a fabric mask:
•	Clean your hands before taking off the mask.
•	Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask.
•	If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean plastic, resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day.
•	Clean your hands after removing the mask.

How to clean a fabric mask:
•	Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees Centigrade/140 degrees Fahrenheit) at least once a day.
•	If it is not possible to wash the mask in hot water, then wash it in soap/detergent and room temperature water, followed by boiling the mask for 1 minute.

General tips:
•	Make sure to clean your hands before touching your mask.
•	Make sure you have your own mask and do not share it with others.
•	Resist the temptation to pull down your mask to your chin or take if off when speaking to other people.
•	Do not store your mask around your arm or wrist or pull it down to rest around your chin or neck. Instead, store it in a clean plastic bag.
How to put on and take off a medical mask:
•	Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 
•	Inspect the mask for tears or holes; do not use a mask that has previously been worn or is damaged.
•	Verify which side is the top – this is usually where the metal strip is.
•	Then, identify the inside of the mask, which is usually the white side.
•	Place the mask on your face covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure that there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Place the straps behind your head or ears. Do not cross the straps because this can cause gaps on the side of the mask.
•	Pinch the metal strip so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
•	Remember, do not touch the front of the mask while using it to avoid contamination; if you accidentally touch it, clean your hands. 

How to take off a medical mask:
•	Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
•	Remove the straps from behind the head or ears, without touching the front of the mask.
•	As you remove the mask, lean forward and pull the mask away from your face.  
•	Medical masks are for single use only; discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin.
•	Clean your hands after touching the mask.
•	Be aware of the condition of the mask; replace it if it gets soiled or damp.
Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are:
•	composed of 3 layers of synthetic nonwoven materials
•	configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle
•	available in different thicknesses
•	have various levels of fluid-resistance and filtration
Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators – FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99.
Medical masks and respirator masks are similar in their protection value. However, respirators are specific for certain procedures and instances because they have a tightly fitted component to them. Respirator masks are designed to protect healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size. Wearing a loose-fitting respirator will not offer the same protection to the wearer and may allow small particles to get inside the mask through the sides.
No, WHO does not advise using masks or respirators with exhalation valves. These masks are intended for industrial workers to prevent dust and particles from being breathed in as the valve closes on inhale. However, the valve opens on exhale, making it easier to breathe but also allowing any virus to pass through the valve opening. This makes the mask ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19 or any other respiratory virus.
No, WHO does not advise using gloves by people in the community. Instead, WHO encourages the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit of public places, such as supermarkets or public/private buildings. This helps reduce germs brought in by people’s hands. By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and other infections.
Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19.
In areas of community or cluster transmission, health workers, caregivers and visitors should wear a mask at all times when in the health facility, even if physical distancing can be maintained. Masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons:
•	Health workers and caregivers include: doctors, nurses, midwives, medical attendants, cleaners, community health workers, and any others working in clinical areas.
•	Health workers must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their mask or face, before and after putting on and removing their masks, as well as before they touch them to readjust them.

In areas with sporadic spread of COVID-19, health workers in clinical areas should wear medical masks throughout their shift apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons.
Health workers should continue to physically distance and avoid unnecessary close contact with colleagues and others in the facility when not providing patient care.
Respirator masks are recommended for use where aerosol generating procedures are in place for a suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patient. In these settings, WHO recommends the use of airborne and contact precautions.
As health workers have been infected with COVID-19 outside of health facilities, it is critical that health workers, as all people, follow the guidance to protect themselves from infection when outside of a health facility.
