# Similarity-Check-between-two-text-documents

Here, in this project we will check the similarity between two text documents using cosine similarity measure 
first step is that doing text preprocessing here i applied different techniques like removing punctuations, lower casing the text, removing stopwords, lemmatizing and tokenization
after doing all the text preprocessing i applied feature engineering techniques here i tried with different techniques like bag of words, word2vec but i am getting good results with tf-idf 
after getting vectors i applied that to cosine similarity measure to find the similairty between those two documents.
here i also added text summarization with built-in summarizer function after doing that i did some preprocessing and add sentiment of testing document and wordcloud of testing document (bigram,trigram)

** Here Similarity is checking based on word to word **

later stage i am thinking to do semantic similarity between those documents
